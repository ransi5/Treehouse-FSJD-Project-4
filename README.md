OOP Game Show App

Changes made to default game design

The color for 'chosen' class applied to keys correctly guessed by user is changed to 'green' as the color represents clearly that the choice was a success and now disabled. `green` is more pleasant than the initial dark purple color and rhymes better with the other colors in the game.

The color for 'wrong' class applied to keys incorrectly guessed by user is changed to 'tomato' as the color represents clearly that the choice was a not correct and now disabled. `tomato` is more pleasant than the initial dark purple color and rhymes better with the other colors in the game.
