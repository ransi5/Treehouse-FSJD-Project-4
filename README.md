OOP Game Show App

Changes made to default game design

The color for 'chosen' class applied to keys chosen by user is changed to 'tomato' as the color represents clearly that the button is disabled. `tomato is more pleasant than the initial dark purple color and rhymes better with the other colors in the game.
